A system aims to contain its existence in the application - changes in the systems should not affect the overall application systems - keeping in mind that the application is dependent of described systems. Also, systems are designed to allow replacement of itself such that a system could be removed but replaced with similar structured systems. The folder structure helps to communicate this design.

## Folder Structure
The folder are named and arranged to communicate self-contained systems of the application. The folder structure aim to give an overview of the form of the application grouped in systems for high level systems of the application and also for self-contained components for the client system.
