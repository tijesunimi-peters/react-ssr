This system is based on the `React` library and is responsible for the views. The UI is broken down in to `React` components making the frontend implementation modular also leveraging off of the lean architecture understanding of partioning based on commonality and variation. Components are self contained in their folders/files - having everything they require to exist independently. Functions general to several components are contained in a separate Component that is then imported into dependent components
